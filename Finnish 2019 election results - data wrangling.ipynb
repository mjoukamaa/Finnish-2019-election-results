    "The data in the `.csv` file consists of nearly fifty different variable fields, many of which are not particularly relevant for modeling purposes, eg. candidate number and voting area identifier. The data is also presented in a very granular manner: the file has candidate-wise rows for each voting area of the electoral districts as well as separate rows for each candidate's electoral district vote totals. Thus, it is quite clear that for modeling purposes most of the data in the `.csv` file is redundant and needs to be pruned heavily in order to be usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a modeling perspective the most usable variables in the raw data are the following: the candidates' first and last name, their gender and age, whether they were members of the Finnish or the European parliament or municipal councillors at the time of the elections, and of course, the candidates' vote totals - the dependent variable which is being predicted by modeling its relationship with the other variables. The first and last names of the candidates aren't used in the modeling per se, but they are necessary for differentiating the candidates from each other when aggregating the data in order to extract the vote totals. Besides the said variables, there are a couple of other background factors, like the candidates' party affiliation and their place of residence, that might provide useful for modeling purposes, but that are somewhat tricky to recode into usable features. I might come back to these variables later on, but for the time being I am leaving them aside."
